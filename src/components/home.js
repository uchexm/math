        the science of structure, order, and relation that has evolved from
        elemental practices of counting, measuring, and describing the shapes of
        objects. It deals with logical reasoning and quantitative calculation,
        and its development has involved an increasing degree of idealization
        and abstraction of its subject matter. Since the 17th century,
        mathematics has been an indispensable adjunct to the physical sciences
        and technology, and in more recent times it has assumed a similar role
        in the quantitative aspects of the life sciences.

        In many cultures—under the stimulus of the needs of practical pursuits,
        such as commerce and agriculture—mathematics has developed far beyond
        basic counting. This growth has been greatest in societies complex
        enough to sustain these activities and to provide leisure for
        contemplation and the opportunity to build on the achievements of
        earlier mathematicians..

        , born in 476 CE, is known as the Father of Indian Mathematics. In the
        6th century BC, the study of mathematics began with the Pythagoreans, as
        a “demonstrative discipline”. The word mathematics originated from the
        Greek word “
        <u>mathema</u>
        ”, which means “subject of instruction”. Another mathematician, named
