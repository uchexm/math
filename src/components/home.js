        is a subject of numbers, shapes, data, measurements and also logical
        activities. It has a huge scope in every field of our life, such as
        medicine, engineering, finance, natural science, economics, etc. We are
        all surrounded by a mathematical world. Mathematics is a subject of
        logic.

        Mathematics is a historical subject. It has been explored by various
        mathematicians across the world since centuries, in different
        civilizations.{' '}

        6th century BC, the study of mathematics began with the Pythagoreans, as
        a “demonstrative discipline”. The word mathematics originated from the
        Greek word “<u>mathema</u>

      <h3>Branches of Mathematics</h3>
      <p>The main branches of mathematics are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Number System</li>
        <li>Algebra </li>
        <li>Geometry</li>
        <li>Calculus</li>
        <li>Topology</li>
        <li>Trigonometry</li>
        <li>Probability</li>
        <li>and Statistics</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These mathematical concepts fall under pure mathematics. These form the
        base of mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Applied mathematics is another form, where mathematicians, scientists or
        technicians use mathematical concepts to solve practical problems. It
        describes the professional use of mathematics.
